function y = filterSignal(x, Fs)
% Filter raw signal
%   y = filterSignal(x, Fs) filters the signal x. Each column in x is one
%   recording channel. Fs is the sampling frequency. The filter delay is
%   compensated in the output y.
Lpass=300;
Hstop=3000;
fBand=[Lpass/(Fs/2),Hstop/(Fs/2)];% normalization of frequency limits
[b,a]=cheby2(7,50,fBand,'bandpass'); % create the chebyshev type II bandpass filter
%h=fvtool(b,a) %visualize the filter if needed
y=filtfilt(b,a,x); % zero-phase delay correction
